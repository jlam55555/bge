b? Game Engine

### About
This is a backup of a project I worked on briefly, intended to be a flexible game library. Scala provides the flexibility in the type system that will allow for implementing a wide range of games. (on the other hand, Golang does not -- it was the original language of choice).

Saving this to GitHub until I decide to work on it again.

(I forgot what the b in the acronym was supposed to stand for)
